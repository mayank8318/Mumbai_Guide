	<p>
	The Gateway of India is one of India's most unique landmarks situated in the city of Mumbai. The colossal structure was constructed in 1924. Located at the tip of Apollo Bunder, the gateway overlooks the Mumbai harbor, bordered by the Arabian Sea in the Colaba district. The Gateway of India is a monument that marks India's chief ports and is a major tourist attraction for visitors who arrive in India for the first time. At one point of time, this monument represented the grandeur of the British Raj in India.

	The structural design of the Gateway of India is constituted of a large arch, with a height of 26m. The monument is built in yellow basalt and indissoluble concrete. The structural plan of Gateway of India is designed in the Indo-Saracenic style. One can also find traces of Muslim architectural styles incorporated in the structure of the grandiose edifice. The central dome of the monument is about 48 feet in diameter, with a total height of 83 feet. Designed with intricate latticework, the 4 turrets are the prominent features of the entire structure of the Gateway of India. There are steps constructed behind the arch of the Gateway that leads to the Arabian Sea. The monument is structured in such a way that one can witness the large expanse of the 'blue blanket' right ahead, welcoming and sending off ships and visitors.

	<p>
		Located close to the concrete jungle of Mumbai, the Elephanta Caves lie just off the coast of the Arabian Sea, situated at a 10 km radius from the bustling metropolis. One of the oldest rock cut structures in the country, the Elephanta Caves are the perfect expressions of archaic Indian art associated to the cult of Lord Shiva. Primarily believed to be the abode of Lord Shiva, the Elephanta Caves are an epitome of Hindu Cave culture and are a unique testimony to a bygone civilization. The origins of the Elephanta Caves have been debated time and again, though the sculptures and the art speak volumes about the time from when they could have been popular-6th or the 8th century. The island on which the caves are built was originally known as Gharapuri, and the Portuguese retitled it as Elephanta Island when they discovered a large stone structure of an Elephant on the island. The temple was primarily built for the worship of Lord Shiva and 'Shivaism'. However, it is believed that the Portuguese destroyed many other structures and even used the idols of Hindu Gods within the caves for target practice. Today, the site is a popular tourist hot-spot.

	A small island just off the coast of the Arabian Sea may be the least expected place for shopping for souvenirs, but get ready to be pleasantly surprised with the collection of local Elephanta souvenirs that you can take back home. Once you are on the island, a short walk uphill will bring you to the local flea market. A paradise for women, this little market offers sculptures made of marble, jewelery, clothes, paintings of Lord Shiva and many amazing items of wood work. If you are collecting Indian artifacts, then there is no better place to shop for souvenirs than the Elephanta Caves. While the prices are a bit exorbitant, it always helps to know the basics of bargaining in the world of barter-especially at unique and beautiful places like the Elephanta Caves.

	The Haji Ali Dargah is a historical landmark in Mumbai, and is also one of the most prestigious Islamic symbols situated in South Mumbai.
